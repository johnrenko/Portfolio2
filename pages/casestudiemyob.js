      <h1>Overview</h1>

      <p>While at MYOB, my role was to help create tools to help small business owners focus on succeeding by streamlining administration processes. I was the lead designer on the payroll project. 
      </p>
      <h1>Problem statement</h1>

      <p>Payroll in NZ is the third most complex in the world. An efficient, simple to use online payroll system has yet to dominate the market. Based on this fact, our task was to redefine payroll processes and make them as straightforward as possible so that business owners and their employees would spend less time possible on this task.
      </p>
      <h1>Users and audience</h1>

      <p>What was interesting was that our users was split into 3 categories:
            The SME who owns the business and gets the value from improving the efficiency of his process
            The employee who we need to get info from but with who we don`t have a direct relationship - therefore harder to create incentive
            Accountants who are the experts that help the SME</p>

      <h1>Team and role</h1>

      <p>I was part of a 4 persons team (PM, BA, Dev lead and UX) that was there from day one, creating the long term strategy. The team then grew to ~10 devs and a second BA.
            My role was to define the problems, design and validate (with users) possible solutions, workshop with the teams to check the different technical / business constraint, help feed the backlog and prioritisation. I also had a strong input in the prioritisation of the backlog and helped make trade-offs decisions. 
      </p>
       <h1>Constraints</h1>

      <p>Due to the structure of the financial year in New Zealand as well as the business need of delivering a solution 2 months prior to this deadline, we were under huge time constraints, which unfortunately made us cut corners at times, or trade-off some on the experience. The dev team also started with a brand new technology - reactjs - which meant that interactions took more time to develop at the start. 
            We were also part of bigger dependencies as the tools were part of a bigger initiative to focus all designs around a styleguide to ensure consistency all across the board.
      </p>
      <h1>Design process story</h1>

      <p>We were lucky enough to start, the product manager, the business analyst the dev manager and me, 3 weeks ahead of the rest of the team. During this head start, we had to define a clear long term strategy as well as build a team that would work efficiently together. 
            We would meet at the end of each week with our stakeholders to make sure our vision was similar to what the business strategy was. 
            During these three weeks, we gathered quantitative numbers, we organised 40 odd interviews, we sketched ideas and checked if they resonated with our users, we travelled all across New Zealand to meet our target audience in their environment and watch how they worked. 
      </p>
      <h2>Discovery phase:</h2> 
     <p> help paint the long term vision with user interviews and sketch - proof of concept of advanced ideas shared with the business, defining a strategy.
           </p><h2>Design phase:</h2> Coming up with the intermediate solution. Starting from what we thought the minimum solution would be, worked with dev and PM to make sure it aligned, tested and gather feedback from user that then changed the MVP (deprioritised some work for others, defined the minimum that we could go out with - example of the report)

      Learn how to work on a long term project, with a lot of people who have opinions, fight for what we think is best within a big company and following guidelines, learn to make trade offs.

      Not pushing enough sometimes. Pushing too much for details other times. Not feeling responsible for the grey areas.
