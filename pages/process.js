                <h4>What problem are we trying to solve?</h4>
                <p>On paper, this part seems obvious. In action, it's the easiest to skip.</p>
                <p>It is so easy to move to solution mode as soon as possible. But that's not how to create great experiences. </p>
                <p>To find the right solution, you must first understand the problem. And not just at a high level, you must master all the different use cases, data related, possible edge cases.</p>
                <p>The discovery phase is aimed at creating this knowledge database. This will then help shape the long term vision and will make the sharing with the team more efficient.</p>
                <p>This part relies on both quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative data (competitors, market analysis, analytics) will help understand the rationale problem. Qualitative data will then give human answers.</p>
                <p>Outputs of this phase goes from market analytics to user journeys, personas, audio snippets. The end goal is to create a common understanding of a problem, as well as documents to help share this.
                It should shape a vision of the future that is shared by the whole team and business.</p>
